# Datasets

We collect datasets from various sources and prepare them taking into account a potentially discriminated group, and an attribute/score in which discrimination can be embodied. Click on the name of a dataset below for details and availability. Some datasets are directly available for download, while others are available upon requests for privacy reasons.
