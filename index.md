The risen prevalence of automated decision-making process is increasing the risk associated with models that can potentially discriminate against disadvantaged groups. The Fairness Measures Project contributes to the development of fairness-aware algorithms and systems by providing relevant datasets and software.  

You may find here a series of [datasets](Pages/Datasets.md) we have collected and/or prepared. These datasets are from
various fields and applications (e.g., finance, law, and human resources). We also provide common [fairness 
definitions in machine learning](Pages/Definitions.md). In addition, you can find a few fairness algorithms, both in the area of [ranking](Pages/Ranking.md) and [classification](Pages/Classification.md). 

We would love to hear your comments and suggestions, please contact [Meike Zehlike](mailto:meike.zehlike@tu-berlin.de?Subject=Fairness%20measures%20website) for any feedback you may have.
